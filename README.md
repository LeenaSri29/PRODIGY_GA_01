🧠 Project Setup and Installation Guide

Follow these simple steps to get this project up and running smoothly on your local machine.

⚙️ Setup and Installation
1. Create a Virtual Environment 🐍

It’s best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Run the following command in your project directory:

python3 -m venv .venv

2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Before installing dependencies, activate the environment you just created. This ensures all packages are installed locally within it.

On macOS/Linux:

source .venv/bin/activate


On Windows:

.venv\Scripts\activate

🚀 Running the Application
3. Install Dependencies 📦

Once your environment is active, install the necessary libraries listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Start the Streamlit App 💻

After installation, you can run the application using:

streamlit run app.py


This command will automatically open the app in your default web browser.

✅ You're All Set!

Your Streamlit application should now be up and running. Explore, modify, and enjoy building your project! 🎉
